2012-12-01 17:27:47 [INFO] <commontypo> quick look at the internet indicates that ./spawn isn't part of stock minecraft
2012-12-01 17:28:14 [INFO] <commontypo> think we would need to mod the server to fix that
2012-12-01 17:28:30 [INFO] <flametofire> the /spawnmob should do it
2012-12-01 17:28:33 [INFO] <flametofire> i sent you a link

2012-12-14 18:16:31 [INFO] <commontypo> definitely - starting to not know where i am half the time as it is
2012-12-14 18:16:51 [INFO] <flametofire> like a giant tree with giant eagles that have command blocks to take us everywhere
2012-12-14 18:17:10 [INFO] <flametofire> just need to build perches at all our locations with command blocks to the hub
2012-12-14 18:17:24 [INFO] <commontypo> yeah, that would do it
2012-12-14 18:20:45 [INFO] <flametofire> what do you think of this cliff face so far dude?
2012-12-14 18:20:55 [INFO] <flametofire> the one im standing against
2012-12-14 18:20:56 [INFO] <commontypo> looking good -
2012-12-14 18:21:04 [INFO] <flametofire> natural?
2012-12-14 18:21:18 [INFO] <commontypo> yeah, much better than the freshly dynamited look as well
2012-12-14 18:21:24 [INFO] <flametofire> sweet
2012-12-14 18:30:31 [INFO] <commontypo> that's the floor level
2012-12-14 18:30:31 [INFO] <flametofire> lol
2012-12-14 18:30:37 [INFO] <flametofire> looking good
2012-12-14 18:30:46 [INFO] <commontypo> it's going to take a while!
2012-12-14 18:31:03 [INFO] <commontypo> there's plenty of under-floor bits as well - not sure if they could be used for anything
2012-12-14 18:31:11 [INFO] <flametofire> thinking we'll turf the bottom and have a lake type bit with a waterpool under the waterfall
2012-12-14 18:31:21 [INFO] <commontypo> sounds good
2012-12-14 18:31:27 [INFO] <flametofire> quite possibly
2012-12-14 18:31:51 [INFO] <flametofire> after the area looks smooth and natural ish, atleast the walls of the cliffs need to look natural
2012-12-14 18:32:04 [INFO] <flametofire> then ill get on the floating land for the tree
2012-12-14 18:32:07 [INFO] <flametofire> etc
2012-12-14 18:35:51 [INFO] <flametofire> we can work on behind the waterfall at another time also
2012-12-14 18:39:40 [INFO] <commontypo> yeah, reckon so
2012-12-14 18:39:49 [INFO] <commontypo> i really need to sort this backup thing out as well

2012-12-14 18:39:57 [INFO] <commontypo> too much time has been invested now
2012-12-14 18:40:12 [INFO] <flametofire> if i could world edit this thing would be done so much fater
2012-12-14 18:40:18 [INFO] <flametofire> faster
2012-12-14 18:40:24 [INFO] <flametofire> fatter too though
2012-12-14 18:46:06 [INFO] <flametofire> man organics are fucking effort lol
2012-12-14 18:46:20 [INFO] <commontypo> yeah, getting it looking right is a pain
2012-12-14 18:46:37 [INFO] <flametofire> although i guess this is geologics
2012-12-14 18:47:10 [INFO] <commontypo> it's one of those things where you can tell when it looks right
2012-12-14 18:47:15 [INFO] <commontypo> but there isn't really a formula for it
2012-12-14 18:47:39 [INFO] <flametofire> yeah, although you can apply techniques to make it look better too
2012-12-14 18:47:58 [INFO] <commontypo> damn, just dynamited the floor
2012-12-14 18:48:04 [INFO] <flametofire> lol

2012-12-15 13:36:58 [INFO] <flametofire> room enough to do something
2012-12-15 13:37:54 [INFO] <commontypo> there's so many caves off to the sides which all seem to be linked up
2012-12-15 13:38:03 [INFO] <flametofire> yeah that too
2012-12-15 13:38:10 [INFO] <flametofire> im well proud of the root structure

2012-12-15 13:39:42 [INFO] <flametofire> trying to make the branches realistic in any way is gonna be tough
2012-12-15 13:40:10 [INFO] <commontypo> it'll look better when there are leaves on it - will hide a lot of the branches anyway
2012-12-15 13:40:33 [INFO] <flametofire> yeah i know, but i've been thinking about trees, theres only leave on the ends of oaks
2012-12-15 13:40:44 [INFO] <commontypo> ah, good point

2012-12-15 13:58:28 [INFO] <commontypo> yeah, that's looking like it
2012-12-15 13:58:36 [INFO] <commontypo> the problem is having to draw it all with cubes
2012-12-15 13:58:41 [INFO] <flametofire> hahaha yeah
